### Lord O Lord, O Lord Have Mercy

Lord O Lord, Lord O Lord have mercy (2)<br />
Christ O Christ, Christ O Christ, have mercy (2)<br />
Lord O Lord, Lord O Lord have mercy (2)<br />

### Glory to God

***Chorus:***<br />
**Glory to God (2)**<br />
**Glory to God in the highest**<br />
**and on earth peace**<br />
**on earth peace to people of good will.**<br />

We praise you, we bless you, we adore you,<br />
We glorify you, we give you thanks<br />
for your great glory.<br />
Lord God, heavenly King,<br />
O God, Almighty Father.<br />

Lord Jesus Christ, Only begotten Son,<br />
Lord God, lamb of God, Son of the Father<br />
You take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us (2)<br />
You take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer (2)<br />
You are seated at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us.<br />

For you alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord<br />
You alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ,<br />
with the Holy Spirit in the glory of God the Father.<br />

Amen.

### Lord I Want to

***Chorus:***<br />
**Lord I want to, I want to offer you**<br />
**I want to offer you everything I have**<br />
**Take my heart Lord, make it like yours, Lord**<br />
**And make me generous to you Oh Lord. (2)**<br />

When I get back home and I am on my own<br />
If I forget this my offering<br />
Just ring a bell in my heart,<br />
Make me with a little start<br />
And I'll remember and I will sing.<br />

When I come across a splinter of your<br />
Cross and I feel I cannot bear<br />
Just give a part on my back,<br />
Just to tell me you are there and<br />
I'll take courage and I won't care.<br />

And in temptation in times of tension<br />
When I am weak and about to fall<br />
Just let me lean on your side,<br />
Let me e'er with you abide<br />
And in your presence, I'll face it all.

### What a Friend We Have in Jesus

What a friend we have in Jesus,<br />
All our sins and griefs to bear!<br />
What a privilege to carry<br />
Everything  to God in prayer!<br />

O what peace we often forfeit,<br />
O what needless pain we bear,<br />
All because we do not carry<br />
Everything to God in prayer!<br />

Have we trials and temptations?<br />
Is there trouble anywhere?<br />
We should never be discouraged,<br />
Take it to the Lord in prayer.<br />

Can we find a friend so faithful<br />
Who will all our sorrows share?<br />
Jesus knows our every weakness,<br />
Take it to the Lord in prayer.<br />

As we weak and heavy-laden<br />
Cumbered with a load of care?<br />
Precious Saviour, still our refuge<br />
Take it to the Lord in prayer.<br />

Do your friends despise, forsake you?<br />
Take it to the Lord in prayer;<br />
In His arms He'll take and shield you,<br />
You will find a solace there.<br />

Blessed Saviour, Thou hast promised<br />
Thou wilt all our burdens bear;<br />
May we ever, Lord, be bringing<br />
All to thee in earnest prayer.<br />

Soon in glory bright, unclouded,<br />
There will be no need for prayer<br />
Rapture, praise and endless worship<br />
Will be our sweet portion there.
