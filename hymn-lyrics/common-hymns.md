### Lord O Lord, O Lord Have Mercy

Lord O Lord, Lord O Lord have mercy (2)<br />
Christ O Christ, Christ O Christ, have mercy (2)<br />
Lord O Lord, Lord O Lord have mercy (2)<br />

### Glory to God

***Chorus:***<br />
**Glory to God (2)**<br />
**Glory to God in the highest**<br />
**and on earth peace**<br />
**on earth peace to people of good will.**<br />

We praise you, we bless you, we adore you,<br />
We glorify you, we give you thanks<br />
for your great glory.<br />
Lord God, heavenly King,<br />
O God, Almighty Father.<br />

Lord Jesus Christ, Only begotten Son,<br />
Lord God, lamb of God, Son of the Father<br />
You take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us (2)<br />
You take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer (2)<br />
You are seated at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us.<br />

For you alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord<br />
You alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ,<br />
with the Holy Spirit in the glory of God the Father.<br />

Amen.
