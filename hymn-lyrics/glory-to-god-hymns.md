### VG.1 SING TO GOD
Sing to God a song of glory,<br />
peace he brings to people on earth.<br />
Worship we the King of heaven<br />
Praise and bless his holy name.<br />

***Chorus:***<br />
**Glory, glory, sing his glory!**<br />
**Glory to our God on high!**<br />

Sing to Christ, the Father's loved one,<br />
Jesus Lord and Lamb of God.<br />
hear our prayer, O Lord, have mercy,<br />
You who bear the sin of all.<br />

Sing to Christ, the Lord and Saviour,<br />
Seated there at God's right hand:<br />
Hear our prayer, O Lord, have mercy,<br />
you alone: the Holy One!<br />

Glory sing to God the Father,<br />
Glory to his only Son.<br />
Glory to the Holy Spirit,<br />
Glory to the three in one.<br />

### VG.2 GLORY! GLORY!
Glory to God in the highest! (2)<br />
Let there be peace and joy for all in whom he is pleased.<br />

***Chorus:***<br />
**Glory, glory to God in the highest! (2)**<br />

Lord God, heavenly King, Almighty God and Father<br />
We worship you, we give you thanks,<br />
We praise you for your glory!<br />

Lord Jesus, Son of the Father,<br />
Lord God, lamb of God,<br />
you take away our every sin,<br />
Have mercy on us.<br />

You alone are the Holy one,<br />
you alone are the Lord<br />
With the Spirit in the glory of God the Father.<br />
Amen.<br />

### VG.5 GLORY BE TO THE FATHER

**Glory be to the Father, Glory be to the Son,**<br />
**Glory be to the Spirit, All glory to our God.**<br />

We praise you, we bless you, we give you thanks.<br />
We praise you for your glory.<br />
We praise you, we bless you, we worship you,<br />
O Lord, our God.<br />

Lord Jesus Christ, only Son of God,<br />
You are one with the Father,<br />
Receive our prayer.<br />

You alone are the Holy one,<br />
You alone are the Lord,<br />
With the Holy Spirit in the glory of God.
