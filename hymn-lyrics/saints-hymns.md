### U.5 TRUST IN THE LORD
***Chorus:*** <br />
**Trust in the Lord, O you saints of God**<br />
**And bless His name (2).**<br />
**Happy are they who trust in Him**<br />
**And bless His name (2).**<br />

Exult, you just, in the Lord our God,<br />
Praise from the upright is fitting.<br />
Sing to Him a new song with the harp,<br />
Pluck the strings with shouts of gladness.<br />

For true indeed is the word of God,<br />
And all his deeds to be trusted.<br />
He loves justice and righteousness.<br />
The earth proclaims his loving kindness.<br />

But see, the eyes of the Lord are trained<br />
On those who hope for his kindness.<br />
Our hearts wait on the living God<br />
Who is our shield and our helper.<br />

For in the Lord all our hearts rejoice.<br />
Holy his name which we trust in.<br />
May your love be upon us, O Lord,<br />
Who have put our hope in you.<br />
