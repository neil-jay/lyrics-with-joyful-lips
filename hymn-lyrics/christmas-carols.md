### Joy to the world

Joy to the world the Lord is come<br />
Let earth receive her king<br />
Let every heart prepare Him room<br />
And heaven and nature sing<br />
And heaven and nature sing<br />
And heaven and Heaven<br />
and nature sing.<br />

Joy to the world the saviour reigns<br />
Let men their songs employ<br />
While fields and floods<br />
rocks hills and plains<br />
Repeat the sounding joy<br />
Repeat the sounding joy<br />
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.<br />

He rules the world<br />
with truth and grace<br />
And makes the nations prove<br />
The glories of His righteousness<br />
And wonders of His love<br />
And wonders of His love<br />
And wonders, wonders of His love.<br />

### Hark! The herald angels sing

Hark! the herald angels sing,<br />
“Glory to the new-born King;<br />
Peace on earth, and mercy mild;<br />
God and sinners reconciled.”<br />
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,<br />
Join the triumph of the skies;<br />
With angelic hosts proclaim,<br />
“Christ is born in Bethlehem.”<br />

Christ, by highest heav’n adored,<br />
Christ, the everlasting Lord:<br />
Late in time behold Him come,<br />
Offspring of a virgin’s womb.<br />
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,<br />
Hail th’ incarnate Deity!<br />
Pleased as man with man to dwell,<br />
Jesus our Immanuel.<br />

### Angels we have heard

Angels we have heard on high<br />
Sweetly singing o'er the plains<br />
And the mountains in reply<br />
Echoing their joyous strains<br />

***Chorus***<br />
**Gloria, in excelsis Deo**<br />
**Gloria, in excelsis Deo**<br />

Shepherds, why this jubilee?<br />
Why your joyous strains prolong?<br />
What the gladsome tidings be<br />
Which inspire your heavenly song?<br />

Come to Bethlehem and see<br />
Him whose birth the angels sing,<br />
Come, adore on bended knee,<br />
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.<br />
