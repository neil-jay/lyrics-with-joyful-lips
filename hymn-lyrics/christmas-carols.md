### Joy to the world

Joy to the world the Lord is come<br />
Let earth receive her king<br />
Let every heart prepare Him room<br />
And heaven and nature sing<br />
And heaven and nature sing<br />
And heaven and Heaven<br />
and nature sing.<br />

Joy to the world the saviour reigns<br />
Let men their songs employ<br />
While fields and floods<br />
rocks hills and plains<br />
Repeat the sounding joy<br />
Repeat the sounding joy<br />
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.<br />

He rules the world<br />
with truth and grace<br />
And makes the nations prove<br />
The glories of His righteousness<br />
And wonders of His love<br />
And wonders of His love<br />
And wonders, wonders of His love.<br />

### Hark! The herald angels sing

Hark! the herald angels sing,<br />
“Glory to the new-born King;<br />
Peace on earth, and mercy mild;<br />
God and sinners reconciled.”<br />
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,<br />
Join the triumph of the skies;<br />
With angelic hosts proclaim,<br />
“Christ is born in Bethlehem.”<br />

Christ, by highest heav’n adored,<br />
Christ, the everlasting Lord:<br />
Late in time behold Him come,<br />
Offspring of a virgin’s womb.<br />
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,<br />
Hail th’ incarnate Deity!<br />
Pleased as man with man to dwell,<br />
Jesus our Immanuel.<br />

### Angels we have heard

Angels we have heard on high<br />
Sweetly singing o'er the plains<br />
And the mountains in reply<br />
Echoing their joyous strains<br />

***Chorus:***<br />
**Gloria, in excelsis Deo**<br />
**Gloria, in excelsis Deo**<br />

Shepherds, why this jubilee?<br />
Why your joyous strains prolong?<br />
What the gladsome tidings be<br />
Which inspire your heavenly song?<br />

Come to Bethlehem and see<br />
Him whose birth the angels sing,<br />
Come, adore on bended knee,<br />
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.<br />

### O Come, All ye faithful

Oh come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;<br />
Come and behold him<br />
born the King of angels;<br />

***Chorus:***<br />
**O come, let us adore him,**<br />
**O come, let us adore him,**<br />
**O come, let us adore him,**<br />
**Christ The Lord.**<br />

Sing choirs of angels,<br />
sing in exultation<br />
Sing all ye citizens of heaven above;<br />
Glory to God, glory in the highest:<br />

Yea, Lord, we greet thee,<br />
born this happy morning;<br />
Jesus, to thee be glory given;<br />
Word of the Father,<br />
now in flesh appearing.<br />

### Silent Night

All is calm, all is bright<br />
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child<br />
Holy Infant so tender and mild<br />
Sleep in heavenly peace<br />
Sleep in heavenly peace.<br />

Silent night, holy night<br />
Shepherds quake at the sight<br />
Glories stream from heaven afar<br />
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia<br />
Christ the Saviour is born<br />
Christ the Saviour is born.<br />

Silent night, holy night<br />
Son of God, love's pure light<br />
Radiant beams from Thy holy face<br />
With the dawn of redeeming grace<br />
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth<br />
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth.<br />

### Dashing Through the Snow

In a one-horse open sleigh<br />
O'er the fields we go<br />
Laughing all the way<br />
Bells on bob tails ring<br />
Making spirits bright<br />
What fun it is to ride and sing<br />
A sleighing song tonight.<br />

***Chorus:***<br />
**Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells**<br />
**Jingle all the way**<br />
**Oh, what fun it is to ride**<br />
**In a one-horse open sleigh,**<br />
**Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells**<br />
**Jingle all the way**<br />
**Oh, what fun it is to ride**<br />
**In a one-horse open sleigh.**<br />

A day or two ago<br />
I thought I'd take a ride<br />
And soon, Miss Fanny Bright<br />
Was seated by my side<br />
The horse was lean and lank<br />
Misfortune seemed his lot<br />
He got into a drifted bank<br />
And then we got upsot.<br />

### Feliz Navidad

Feliz Navidad<br />
Feliz Navidad<br />
Prospero ano y felicidad<br />

We wanna wish you<br />
a happy Christmas<br />
We wanna wish you<br />
a happy Christmas<br />
We wanna wish you<br />
a happy Christmas<br />
From the bottom of our heart.<br />

### We wish you a Happy Christmas

We wish you a happy Christmas<br />
And a happy New Year!<br />

Good tidings we bring,<br />
To you and your kin<br />
Good tidings of Christmas,<br />
And a happy New Year.<br />

### Go! Tell it on the Mountain

Go, tell it on the mountain<br />
Over the hills and everywhere<br />
Go, tell it on the mountain<br />
That Jesus Christ is born!<br />

When I was a seeker,<br />
I sought both night and day;<br />
I asked my Lord to help me,<br />
And he showed me the way.<br />

While shepherds kept their watching<br />
O'er silent flocks by night<br />
Behold throughout the heavens<br />
There shone a Holy light.<br />

The shepherds feared and trembled<br />
When, lo! Above the earth<br />
Rang out the angel chorus<br />
That hailed our Saviour’s birth.<br />

### Rudolph the Red nosed reindeer

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer<br />
Had a very shiny nose<br />
And if you ever saw it<br />
You would even say it glows.<br />

All of the other reindeer<br />
Used to laugh and call him names<br />
They never let poor Rudolph<br />
Join in any reindeer games.<br />

Then one foggy Christmas Eve<br />
Santa came to say<br />
“Rudolph, with your nose so bright<br />
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?”<br />

Then how the reindeer loved him<br />
As they shouted out with glee<br />
“Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer<br />
You'll go down in history”.<br />

### Christmas Polka

This is Christmas season so there isn't any reason<br />
We can't dance the Christmas polka<br />
Hear sleigh-bells ringing’<br />
everybody's singing<br />
Dancing the Christmas polka.<br />

Christmas trees and holly make everyone so jolly<br />
And love just fills the air<br />
It's a wonderful world for<br />
a boy and a girl<br />
While dancing the Christmas polka.<br />

A merry Christmas polka,<br />
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance<br />
Everyone's so happy,<br />
the air is filled with romance<br />
Watch the sweethearts kissing'<br />
As they dance underneath the mistletoe<br />
It's a sight to behold for the<br />
young and the old<br />
A merry Christmas polka.<br />

### Long time ago in Bethlehem

Long time ago in Bethlehem<br />
So the Holy Bible say<br />
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ<br />
Was born on Christmas day.<br />

Hark now hear the angels sing<br />
A new king born today,<br />
And man will live for evermore<br />
Because of Christmas day.<br />

Trumpets sound and angels sing<br />
Listen what they say,<br />
That man will live for evermore<br />
Because of Christmas day.<br />

Now Joseph and his wife Mary<br />
Come to Bethlehem that night,<br />
Then find no place to born the child<br />
Not a single room was in sight.<br />
