Lamb of God, have mercy.<br />
You free the world from sinfulness,<br />
Have mercy, Lord have mercy.<br />

Receive our prayer, O Son of the Father,<br />
Hear our cry for mercy.<br />
As from your seat at his right hand<br />
You share the throne of glory.<br />

For you are Lord, the One and the holy.<br />
With the Holy Spirit,<br />
You are the only Lord most high,<br />
In glory with the Father.
