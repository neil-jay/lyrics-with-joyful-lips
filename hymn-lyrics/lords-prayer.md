### Y.1 Lord's Prayer

When he saw how great was their number,<br />
Jesus went up to the mountain,<br />
There he sat.<br />
His disciples came about him;<br />
This was the teaching he gave:<br />

**Ant.: Blest are they, blest are they! (Happy indeed!)**

Blessed are the poor in spirit,<br />
the kingdom of heaven is theirs.

Blessed are the patient,<br />
for they shall possess the land.

Blessed are those who mourn,<br />
for they shall be comforted.

Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for justice,<br />
for they shall have their fill.

Blessed are the merciful,<br />
for they shall obtain mercy.

Blessed are the clean of heart,<br />for they shall see God.

Blessed are the peacemakers,<br />
for they shall be called the sons of God.

Blessed are those who suffer persecution for justice sake,<br />
the kingdom of heaven is theirs.

**All.: Rejoice and exult, be gladsome and joyful:**<br />
**Your reward in heaven shall be rich, shall be great.**
