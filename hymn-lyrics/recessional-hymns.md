### X.2 LONG LIVE THE LORD
Ant.:<br />
**Long live the Lord, for he is my Saviour!**<br />

For he is my light, for he is my Saviour!<br />
For he is my stronghold, for he is my Saviour!<br />

***Chrous:***<br />
**For he is my Shepherd,**<br />
**And to him I sing all my praises,**<br />
**To him I pledge my love!**<br />

For he is my rock,<br />
For he is my rampart.<br />

For he is my life,<br />
For he is my refuge.<br />

For he is my love,<br />
In him, joy for ever.<br />

For he is my way,<br />
With him, I am walking.<br />

### X.3 TO THE WORLD WE GO
Lightened by the word we’ve heard,<br />
To the world we all must go,<br />
Nourished by the bread of life,<br />
To the world we go.<br />

***Chorus:***<br />
**Altogether in one love and faith,**<br />
**Seeking ever to be true,**<br />
**You will guide us on the path, O Lord,**<br />
**Of eternal peace.**<br />

With our joys and with our cares,<br />
To the world we all must go,<br />
Weighed by toil but raised by hope,<br />
To the world we go.<br />

Joined in peace and unity,<br />
To the world we all must go,<br />
Gathered in your charity,<br />
To the world we go.<br />

### X.4 HAND IN HAND WITH CHRIST
***Chorus:*** <br />
**Hand in hand with Christ, our Brother,**<br />
**His love we'll show;**<br />
**We will rise and leave the house of God,**<br />
**To all we'll go.**<br />

Grant, O Lord, that we may journey<br />
On the way that was your own,<br />
For our neighbours ever caring<br />
In the way you've shown.<br />

Let all petty strife be banished,<br />
Teach us all the way of peace<br />
So that, living as companions,<br />
All our fears may cease.<br />

With the fire of love now burning,<br />
By the power of God made strong,<br />
Give us, Lord, to spread your message<br />
And proclaim your truth.<br />

### (X)X.5 HAVING SHARED THE PASCHAL MEAL
Having shared the paschal meal,<br />
By his body strengthened,<br />
We give thanks to the Lord,<br />
Leaving now the house of God,<br />
By his word instructed,<br />
We give thanks to the Lord.<br />

***Chorus:***<br />
**Ref.:**
**Alleluia, alleluia, go in peace, love the Lord,**<br />

**Alleluia, make known his mighty deeds,**<br />
**Alleluia, make known his love.**<br />

Ready now to be the salt<br />
Of the world around us, We give...<br />
And prepared to be the light,<br />
Shining from the mountains, We give...<br />

Knowing too that charity<br />
Is of all the greatest, We give...<br />
And resolved to show through love<br />
We are his disciples, We give...<br />

Having heard his pressing call<br />
To remain united, We give...<br />
Resolute to bring his peace<br />
In a world divided, We give...<br />

### (X)X.11 I NOW NO LONGER LIVE

Christ in my mind, (in) my life, (in) my heart.<br />
Christ to the world with joy I must bring.<br />

Christ on my right, (on) my left, (all) around.<br />
Christ to the world with joy I must bring.<br />

Christ to the world with joy I must bring.<br />

**Renewed and ready to serve.**<br />

Together we have shared this meal.<br />
The bread of unity.<br />
Help us, Lord, to build a world,<br />
Where love and charity abide.<br />

That shines for all to see.<br />
Send your Spirit in our hearts<br />

Help your witnesses to stand<br />
And speak the words of truth and life.<br />

To praise and honour the Trinity.<br />

The peace and joy of Christ.<br />

Go, the Mass is ended, strengthened in the Lord,<br />

This day is yours to change the world,<br />
To make God known and loved.<br />

**The Good news a sword in your hand.**<br />

Let your loins be girt and your lamps alight,<br />
Waiting for the day when the Master comes.<br />
May he find you watching when he returns:<br />
He’ll come like a thief in the night.<br />

If we are not faithful, he’ll still keep faith<br />
For he can’t be false to himself.<br />

There is a river that brings us joy,<br />
It flows through the city of our God,<br />
And in this city God Himself dwells<br />
And therefore it will never be destroyed. So...<br />

The nations tremble and kingdoms shake,<br />
For God speaks and all the earth dissolves.<br />
The Lord Almighty is here with us.<br />
The God of Jacob helps us in distress. So...<br />

So come and see his amazing works,<br />
He causes wars to end throughout the world,<br />
And every weapon He does destroy.<br />
"Be still", He says "and know that I am God". So...<br />

**Thank you most of all.**<br />

You forgive us when we falter,<br />
You bring healing when we sin,<br />
You redeem our life from bondage,<br />
And renew us deep within.<br />

As the rain comes down from heaven,<br />
And it makes the earth yield fruits,<br />
So the Word that you once planted<br />
In our heart has taken root.<br />

You have brought us out of darkness<br />
To the kingdom of your Son,<br />
In whom all things hold together,<br />
By whose cross we are made one.<br />

While the heavens sing your glory<br />
And the skies proclaim your work,<br />
Day to day takes up the story,<br />
Night to night declares your Word.<br />

Whom you send to us to stay,<br />
For he helps us in our weakness<br />
When we know not how to pray.<br />

**Go in peace to be Christ's body.**<br />
**Go in peace, proclaim his word.**<br />
**You have shared his dying and his rising.**<br />
**Go in peace, Christ lives in you.**<br />

But our treasure is in earthen vessels,<br />
Proving we are weak and need God's strength.<br />
Carrying in our flesh the death of Jesus,<br />
We must show his life at work in us.<br />

Though our outer nature may seem wasted.<br />
Daily is the inner man renewed,<br />
For the love of Jesus Christ controls us,<br />
Since we know that one man died for all.<br />

**For in union with Christ we are led to victory,**<br />
**Thanks be to God! (3)**<br />

We are Christ's fragrance that goes<br />
everywhere to save,<br />
The incense that burns to bring new life.<br />

We bear his message, not as peddlers<br />
of God's Word,<br />
But armed with sincerity and truth.<br />

We are Christ's letter written on the human heart,<br />
Inscribed by the Spirit of the Lord.<br />

### X.31 COLOURS OF DAY
Colours of day dawn into the mind,<br />
The Sun has come up, the night is behind.<br />
Go down to the city, into the street<br />
And let’s give the message to the people we meet.<br />

***Chorus:*** <br />
**So light up the fire and let the flame burn,**<br />
**Open the door, let Jesus return.**<br />
**Take seeds of His Spirit, let the fruit grow,**<br />
**Tell the people of Jesus, let his love show.**<br />

Go through the park, on into the town,<br />
The sun still shines on, it never goes down.<br />
The light of the world is risen again,<br />
The people of darkness are needing our friend.<br />

Open your eyes, look into the sky,<br />
The darkness has come, the sun came to die,<br />
The evening draws on, the sun disappears;<br />
But Jesus is living and His Spirit is near.<br />

### X.33 YOU SHALL GO OUT WITH JOY
***Chorus:*** <br />

**There'll be shouts of joy and all the trees of the field**<br />
**Will clap, will clap their hands.**<br />

And all the trees of the field will clap their hands (3)<br />
While you go out with joy!<br />

And all the birds of the sky will chirp and sing (3)<br />
While you go out with joy!<br />

And all the angels of heav'n will flap their wings (3)<br />
While you go out with joy!<br />

### X.34 WE WERE ONCE IN DARKNESS
We were once in darkness, now our eyes can see,<br />
We were lost but Jesus sought and found us.<br />
O what love He offers, O what peace He gives,<br />
We will sing for evermore: He lives!<br />

***Chorus:*** <br />
**Hallelujah Jesus, Hallelujah Lord!**<br />
**Hallelujah, Christ the Lord is risen from the dead!**<br />
**We will live for ever, we will never die,**<br />
**We will live for ever with the Lord!**<br />

We are God's own people, forward we must go,<br />
We are called from darkness into freedom.<br />
Nourished at this table joyously we leave,<br />
Strengthened by the Spirit of the Lord.<br />

### X.35 LET YOUR FACE SHINE FORTH
***Chorus:***<br />
**Let your face shine forth the glory of God;**<br />
**And his message of love let your lips proclaim.**<br />
**Arise, make known the deed of your God;**<br />
**Let the nations tremble before his holy name.**<br />

Seek his Kingdom and its treasure within,<br />
And you will know eternal life.<br />
Arise and walk with a heart full of singing,<br />
Let the whole world know: you are a people<br />
of the Lord.<br />

"Love one another as I have loved you".<br />
Thus says the Lord to all his friends.<br />
In harmony let us all live together;<br />
Let the whole world know: we are a people<br />
of the Lord.
